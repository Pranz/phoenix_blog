title: A weird tic

I was watching an episode of a show I already watched and noticed myself doing this thing.
When I thought about it, I remember doing it a lot when I was younger but I stopped with
it some time ago. Except when I'm really bored apperently.

### The tic
Whenever I would watch TV, i would pay special attention to the dialogue. It would come up as if I
was reading a transcript, and I would try to find a grouping of words such that the character count
would add up to 10. Pretty wacky description I know, an example is in order.

Take the above paragraph, "would watch" would be the first occurence. Eventually I would construct all sorts of crazy rules, like punctuation and other characters would either count as 1 or 0, my
choice, and I would try both of them to see if I could get it to 10. And all of this I did while
watching, transcribing it in my head and adding up the character counts.

I must've gotten pretty good at it to do it all simultaneously, and keep in mind I'm not even a native english speaker and most shows I watched, if not all were in english. Really strange, but thought it would be fun to write down to help me remember some of the weird stuff I did as a kid and young teen. I was pretty weird, so there's a lot of them.
