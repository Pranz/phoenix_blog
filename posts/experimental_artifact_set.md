My favorite thing about card games is designing my own cards. Cards are usually very simple on
their own and the complexity comes from imagining how a card interacts with all other---both existing and potential---cards in the game. To me it's a very relaxing experience and I find myself thinking about card games a lot more than I play them. Magic is the prime example of this, my friends have never been interested in Magic so I haven't played it much at all but I've poured hours and hours
reading articles about it, looking through sets and decklists, and of course thinking about potential designs.

**Enter Artifact**. I've been a long time DotA player so I was already interested in the game and
after seeing the gameplay videos from PAX I knew this was a game I would love. And sure enough,
in about 2 months I clocked 100 hours into the game and I can say without a doubt it's the best card
game I've ever played. So naturally I've been thinking about some designs of my own and would like to share. Hope you enjoy!

### Sink hole
```
Green spell --- 9 

Condemn a unit. This card costs X less where X is opponent towers spent mana.
```

Initiative (whoever gets to play a card first in a lane) is very important in Artifact. If you can remove or silence your opponents off initiative they have no ways to play their cards in that lane.
The exemption to this is the green color. Green has very little removal and often benefits more from reacting to the opponents plays. I think this is an interesting concept and this card is done in this way. Using it off initiative costs a ton of mana and is not very efficient, but this can remove a very large threat for very little cost later in the game. It can remove heroes, but it gives them the ability to spend their mana first so I think this is fairly balanced.

### Envigorated Rhino
```
Green creep --- 5

5 / 0 / 8
+X siege, where X is your remaining mana.
```

There aren't many 5 mana creatures, and most are pretty bad. Red mist pillager is the one 5-drop that I think is on a very good power level, not extremely good and very situational, but can get out of hand if not responded to. Green however has a bigger creep theme and think it would benefit from having strong 5-drops. This particular card also plays into the theme of reactivity green has. Good as a body earlier in the game and can potentially deal a lot damage later if you can afford to not spend your mana.

### Observer ward
```
Item - Consumable --- 2 gold

During the next deployment phase, enemy melee creeps are deployed to another lane if possible.
```

This is more of a concept card. This is possibly strongest in red and/or black decks which typically has more narrow boards, and a creep in front of a hero blocks significant damage.

### Toll guards of Revtel
```
Black creep --- 4

2 / 0 / 5
Each item in all shops costs +2 gold.
```

Good against cheaper items and for black decks wanting to save up gold instead of spending it early.

### Troll Warlord
```
Red hero

4 / 0 / 8

Ability: Fervor
Whenever you play a non-item card costing 2 or less, quickdraw
```

#### Berserkers rage
```
Troll Warlord signature card
Red spell --- 2 mana

Give a red hero death shield and +4 attack until end of round. Your opponent chooses a combat target for it.
```

Qucikdraw is a custom keyword, which is like "Get initiative" but do not carry over to the next lane.
I think trolls ability would be very interesting and powerful, hence his poor statline. With the ability you can do stuff like poised to strike into berserkers call or duel.
